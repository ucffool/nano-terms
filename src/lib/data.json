        "detailed_definition": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a hybrid approach in natural language processing that integrates information retrieval techniques with generative models. It first retrieves relevant documents from a corpus based on the user's query and then uses these documents to generate a response through a language model, aiming for more accurate and contextually relevant answers.",

          "RAG can be compared to using a library to find books that might contain information about a topic you are interested in (retrieval) and then reading those books to write an essay or answer questions (generation)."

        "detailed_definition": "AI agents are software entities programmed to perceive their environment, reason about it, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. These can be chatbots, virtual assistants, robots, or any other intelligent system that operates autonomously or with minimal human intervention. They use a variety of techniques including machine learning, natural language processing, and decision-making algorithms to interact effectively.",

        "detailed_definition": "The temperature parameter is used in generative models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) to adjust the creativity and diversity of the generated text. A low temperature value makes the model more deterministic and focused, producing responses that are more likely to be accurate and on-topic. Conversely, a high temperature introduces more randomness, leading to more varied and unpredictable outputs, which can sometimes result in more creative or novel ideas.",
        "analogies": [
          "Adjusting the temperature parameter is like turning up or down the volume of a radio; it changes how clearly you hear the music but also affects its diversity."
